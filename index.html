        <h2>About This Application</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Family Relationship Chatbot, an intelligent conversational system that understands 
            and processes family relationships using logic-based inference. This chatbot leverages PROLOG as 
            its inference engine to maintain a knowledge base of family relationships and answer complex queries 
            about them.
